Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models trained on clinical data.

📌 Overview

Preprocessed data: handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and applied feature scaling.

Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

Achieved ~85% accuracy on test data.

📂 Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
 (replace with your dataset link if different)

Target: 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease.
